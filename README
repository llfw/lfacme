lfacme: a simple ACME client based on uacme
===========================================

lfacme is a wrapper around uacme to make it a bit more flexible.  i wrote it
primarily for my own use, but you're welcome to use it too.

currently, there is one major limitation: the only supported domain validation
method is dns-01 with Kerberized nsupdate.  patches to improve this would be
welcome.  if you don't want to use Kerberos, you can provide your own
uacme-compatible challenge handler, or just use one from uacme itself.

it's only tested on FreeBSD and may or may not work on other platforms.
if it doesn't work, it shouldn't be difficult to port.

requirements
------------

+ POSIX-compatible /bin/sh
+ uacme (in FreeBSD: security/uacme)
+ OpenSSL command-line tool
+ BIND's "dig" and "nsupdate" (in FreeBSD: dns/bind-tools)
+ Kerberos kinit (either MIT or Heimdal should work)

install
-------

# make install [DESTDIR=/some/where]

usage
-----

+ if you're using the provided "kerberos" challenge handler, make sure
  /etc/krb5.keytab exists since this will be used to issue the Kerberos
  ticket for domain validation.
+ create the config files (see below):
	/usr/local/etc/uacme/acme.conf and
	/usr/local/etc/uacme/domains.conf
+ run "lfacme-setup" to create an ACME account
+ run "lfacme-renew" to issue certificates
+ put "lfacme-renew" in cron if you want to renew certificates automatically.
  it's fine to run this once a day, since it won't renew certificates unless
  they're going to expire soon.

known issues
------------

+ lfacme assumes it's installed in /usr/local.  if you want to change this,
  you'll need to edit the scripts.

+ we disable ARI in uacme (uacme --no-ari) because it's broken on non-glibc
  platforms.  this is a uacme bug: https://github.com/ndilieto/uacme/issues/91.
  the only impact of this is that certificates will be renewed 30 days before
  expiry, instead of when the ACME server wants us to renew them.
 
config files
------------

there are two configuration files:

+ acme.conf configures the global behaviour of lfacme
+ domains.conf lists the certificates lfacme should issue

these both come with manual pages which explain how to configure them,
and sample configs are provided.

BIND + Kerberos configuration
-----------------------------

if you want to use the default (and only) Kerberos dns-01 challenge, you must
configure your DNS server to accept Kerberos-authenticated dynamic updates.

first, tell BIND where to load its Kerberos keytab from:

options {
        tkey-gssapi-keytab "/usr/local/etc/namedb/krb5.keytab";
};

the keytab MUST contain a server key for "DNS/name.of.server@<realm>", where
"name.of.server" MUST be the SOA MNAME for the zone(s) you want to update.
this is not configurable, it's a requirement of how the protocol works.

an update policy like this will allow any host to update ACME challenges for
its own hostname:

	update-policy {
		# note: "EXAMPLE.ORG" is the Kerberos realm, not the DNS zone!
		grant EXAMPLE.ORG krb5-selfsub . TXT;
	};

or to let a specific host update some other records:

	update-policy {
		grant "host/server.example.org@EXAMPLE.ORG"
			name _acme-challenge.example.org. TXT;

		grant "host/server.example.org@EXAMPLE.ORG"
			name _acme-challenge.www.example.org. TXT;
	};

this might also work with the Microsoft Windows DNS server,
but that hasn't been tested.
